-The goal of the project is to test a wheather temperature storage system using blackbox and whitebox testing techniques.

-The system is an application that permits users to manage the weather condition by means of data
insertion, deletion, sorting, and display etc. The application is also a demonstration of how the
information related to weather condition is handled by basic data structures of arrays, unidirectional
linked lists, and bidirectional linked lists.
